# Voting DApp

A minimal decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet using Solidity, Hardhat, and React. This DApp allows users to vote for candidates in a simple, transparent, and secure manner.

## **Features**
- Register candidates and voters
- Cast votes securely
- Prevent double voting
- Simple and intuitive UI (planned for later implementation)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting.git
   cd voting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Alchemy API key and MetaMask private key as follows:

```plaintext
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key
```

- **ALCHEMY_API_KEY**: Obtain from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) by creating a new app and selecting the Ethereum Sepolia network.
- **PRIVATE_KEY**: Export your private key from MetaMask. **Keep this key secure and never share it publicly!**

### **Obtain Test ETH**

To interact with the Sepolia testnet, you need some test ETH. You can get Sepolia ETH from the following faucets:

- [Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.dev/)
- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

### **Deployment**

Deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### **Testing**

Run the tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### **Planned Features**

- Minimal React frontend for interacting with the Voting DApp.
- Enhanced security features and additional contract functions.

## **Commands Cheat Sheet**

- **Compile Contracts**: Compile your Solidity contracts with Hardhat.
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy your contracts to Sepolia.
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
  ```

- **Run Tests**: Run tests with Hardhat.
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```
